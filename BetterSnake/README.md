# Better Snake

A browser-based Snake-style game with power-ups and level progression.

## How to Play

Open `index.html` in your browser. Use the arrow keys to control the snake. Collect food to grow longer and increase your score. Every 10 points advances you to the next level up to level 5. Starting at level 3, stationary obstacles appear.

Power-ups occasionally spawn:

- **speed** – temporarily doubles your speed
- **slow** – temporarily slows the game
- **shrink** – temporarily shortens your snake

You have three lives. Colliding with your tail or an obstacle costs a life. When all lives are lost, the game ends.

## Files

- `index.html` – page markup
- `styles.css` – styling
- `game.js` – game logic

Enjoy!
