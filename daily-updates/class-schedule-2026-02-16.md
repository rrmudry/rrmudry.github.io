## Thursday, Feb 19
- **Lesson Title**: Ice Cube / Heatsink Lab (WICOR Walk)
- **WICOR / AVID**:
  - **Collaboration**: Table group inquiry & data collection.
  - **Inquiry**: Discrepant event (Predicting vs. Observing).
- **WICOR Walk Highlights for Visitors**:
  - **Inquiry (The Hook)**: Essential Question clearly posted. Students make a "Prediction" in their notebooks to demonstrate the Inquiry component of WICOR.
  - **Collaboration**: Structured table groups with assigned roles (Lead Scientist, Data Recorder, Timekeeper).
  - **Writing (CER)**: Students complete a Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER) statement.
    - *Claim*: Metal is a better conductor than wood.
    - *Evidence*: The ice melted in 30 seconds on metal vs. 5 minutes on wood.
    - *Reasoning*: Reference Wednesday's reading to explain that metal atoms transfer momentum more efficiently.
  - **Organization**: AVID binders/notebooks out with Wednesday's annotated reading visible.
- **Goal**: Bridge the gap between "it feels cold" and "it moves energy efficiently."
