## 2026-01-15
- **Lesson Title**: Hey! Stop that thing!! (Impulse)
- **Planned Activities**:
  - Describe, draw, and calculate:
- **Actual Activities**:
  - Create a scenario where an object with momentum is brought to a stop by an impulse. Draw a simple picture of the situation and then write a short word problem describing it. Keep it fun and straightforward!  You will need an object with mass that is moving with a velocity and something that will stop your object by applying a force for some time.
