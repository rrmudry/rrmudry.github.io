# Thermodynamics Unit Outline

### Phase 1: The Fundamentals (The "What")
Before diving into the math, you must establish the core vocabulary and concepts.
* **Temperature vs. Heat:** Distinguishing between average kinetic energy (**Temperature**) and the transfer of thermal energy (**Heat**).
* **Thermal Equilibrium:** Understanding that heat always flows from "hot" to "cold" until they reach the same temperature.
* **System vs. Surroundings:** Defining the specific object of study (usually a gas in a container) versus everything else in the universe.

### Phase 2: Thermal Properties of Matter
This section explores how different materials react when energy is added or removed.
* **Specific Heat Capacity:** Using the formula $q = mc\Delta T$ to determine how much energy is required to change an object's temperature.
* **Latent Heat (Phase Changes):** Calculating the energy required to change a state of matter (like melting ice or boiling water) without changing the actual temperature.
* **Thermal Expansion:** Observing how solids and liquids expand or contract when heated or cooled.

### Phase 3: The Laws of Thermodynamics (The "Rules")
The governing principles that dictate how energy behaves.
* **The Zeroth Law:** If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other (the logic behind thermometers).
* **The First Law (Energy Conservation):** Expressed as $\Delta U = Q + W$. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred between internal energy, heat, and work.
* **The Second Law (Entropy):** The principle that the universe tends toward disorder (entropy) and that heat engines can never be 100% efficient.

### Phase 4: Ideal Gas Processes
High school units focus on "Ideal Gases" to simplify calculations. You will study four specific ways a gas can change state:
1.  **Isothermal:** The process occurs at a **constant temperature**.
2.  **Isobaric:** The process occurs at a **constant pressure**.
3.  **Isochoric (Isometric):** The process occurs at a **constant volume**.
4.  **Adiabatic:** A process where **no heat** is exchanged with the surroundings.

### Phase 5: Heat Engines and Efficiency
The final phase applies these concepts to real-world mechanical systems.
* **PV Diagrams:** Learning to interpret graphs of **Pressure vs. Volume** to calculate the "Work" done by or on a system.
* **Heat Engines:** Analyzing how a system absorbs heat, performs work, and exhausts waste heat.
* **Efficiency:** Calculating the ratio of "useful work" performed to the total "heat input" consumed.
